better describe these, we highlight three major phases: Preparation (e.g. proposing, designing, implementing,

derisking, etc), Model Training (e.g. running the model, optimizing, identifying and mitigating issues),

and Post-training (e.g. evaluations, studies, paper writing). We also include a set of full-project-lifecycle

contributions.

models.

The writing of this report was an experiment: we had over 100 people from different backgrounds

come together to write a single report covering a wide range of aspects of foundation models. A

large part of this report is a survey of existing work, but through many discussions, we have unified

it in one report to highlight all the interdisciplinary connections.

Structure. The report is divided into 26 sections, each discussing one aspect of foundation models.
While we have sought to capture most of the important topics surrounding foundation models,

this report will inevitably be incomplete, especially as the field evolves quickly. For example, many

applications (e.g., natural sciences, music, finance, agriculture) are not included, though they are as

likely to be affected as the applications we have chosen to discuss. It would also be interesting to
of the full potential of foundation models, as is envisioned and discussed in detail throughout this

report, will rely on research of new architectural and modeling advances to fulfill these desiderata.On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models 81

4.2 Training

Authors: Alex Tamkin

Training objectives are mathematical functions describing how to transform a model architecture

and large amount of broad data into a foundation model. For example, GPT-3 was trained with
